# CPP Modules  

The **CPP Modules** project is a comprehensive introduction to object-oriented programming (OOP) in C++. It is divided into a series of modules, each focusing on specific aspects of C++ programming, such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, file handling, and advanced features like templates and operator overloading.  

## How It Works  

1. **Module Breakdown**  
   - The project is split into modules, each with its own objectives and tasks. Examples include:  
     - **Module 00**: Basics of C++ (classes, member functions, namespaces).  
     - **Module 01**: Memory allocation, references, and pointers.  
     - **Module 02**: Ad hoc polymorphism and operator overloading.  
     - **Module 03**: Inheritance and OOP design principles.  
     - **Module 04**: Abstract classes, interfaces, and polymorphism.  
     - **Module 05**: Exception handling and robustness.  
     - **Module 06**: C++ type casting.  
     - **Module 07**: Templates and generic programming.  
     - **Module 08**: Containers and iterators.  

2. **Core C++ Concepts Explored**  
   - **Encapsulation**: Understanding how to create and manage classes with private, protected, and public members.  
   - **Inheritance and Polymorphism**: Designing and implementing hierarchical relationships between classes.  
   - **Dynamic Memory Management**: Utilizing `new`, `delete`, and smart pointers to avoid memory leaks.  
   - **Operator Overloading**: Customizing the behavior of operators for user-defined types.  
   - **Templates**: Creating generic and reusable code for different data types.  
   - **Exception Handling**: Managing errors gracefully with `try`, `catch`, and `throw`.  

3. **Focus on Best Practices**  
   - Adherence to **OOP principles** such as SOLID design.  
   - Writing clean, modular, and maintainable code.  
   - Using modern C++ features while understanding backward compatibility.  

## What I Learned  
- The principles of object-oriented programming and how to implement them in C++.  
- How to design flexible and reusable code using inheritance, polymorphism, and templates.  
- Efficient memory management, including handling edge cases like dangling pointers and memory leaks.  
- The power of C++ as a systems-level and application-level programming language.  
- Advanced debugging techniques and the importance of testing in software development.  
- Developing a deeper understanding of how C++ compares to C in terms of features and paradigms.
